# Design decisions

## DD-001: Language and build system

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Use C++20 without compiler-specific language extensions. Use CMake as the
canonical build description. MSVC is the reference implementation environment,
while portable behavior remains mandatory.

## DD-002: C ABI and exceptions

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Develop the internal C++ core together with a deliberately small C ABI. The ABI
uses opaque handles, fixed-width integer fields, stable numeric error codes, and
caller-owned buffers. Public symbolic values use fixed-width integer typedefs
rather than ABI-dependent C enum storage. Exceptions are not an API mechanism and never cross the
C boundary. ABI adapters translate allocation failure to `out_of_memory` and
other unexpected failures to `internal_error`.

The ABI version is independent of the stream-format version. Extensible public
configuration structures will begin with their structure size and ABI version.

## DD-003: Library forms

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Build static and shared libraries from the same source list. On Windows, the
shared library is `marc.dll` with its import library, while the static archive
uses the distinct name `marc_static.lib` to prevent artifact collisions.

## DD-004: Frame and entropy-block relationship

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Entropy blocks never cross frame boundaries. A frame contains zero or more
complete entropy blocks followed by an optional short final block. Closing a
frame closes the current entropy block and resets frame-scoped state.

## DD-005: Initial allocation and size scope

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Allocator callbacks are outside the initial API. The baseline encoder requires
the original uncompressed size before it emits the stream header. Supporting an
unknown original size requires an explicit later format variant or compatible
versioned extension.

## DD-006: Independent implementation terminology

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Describe the project as a **specification-driven independent implementation**.
Do not claim a formal clean-room process or a legal guarantee. Algorithm work
is derived from recorded specifications, papers, and independently written
designs rather than implementation source code with incompatible provenance.
