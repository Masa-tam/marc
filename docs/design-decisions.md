# Design decisions

## DD-001: Language and build system

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Use C++20 without compiler-specific language extensions. Use CMake as the
canonical build description. MSVC is the reference implementation environment,
while portable behavior remains mandatory.

## DD-002: C ABI and exceptions

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Develop the internal C++ core together with a deliberately small C ABI. The ABI
uses opaque handles, fixed-width integer fields, stable numeric error codes, and
caller-owned buffers. Public symbolic values use fixed-width integer typedefs
rather than ABI-dependent C enum storage. Exceptions are not an API mechanism and never cross the
C boundary. ABI adapters translate allocation failure to `out_of_memory` and
other unexpected failures to `internal_error`.

The ABI version is independent of the stream-format version. Extensible public
configuration structures will begin with their structure size and ABI version.

## DD-003: Library forms

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Build static and shared libraries from the same source list. On Windows, the
shared library is `marc.dll` with its import library, while the static archive
uses the distinct name `marc_static.lib` to prevent artifact collisions.

## DD-004: Frame and entropy-block relationship

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Entropy blocks never cross frame boundaries. A frame contains zero or more
complete entropy blocks followed by an optional short final block. Closing a
frame closes the current entropy block and resets frame-scoped state.

## DD-005: Initial allocation and size scope

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Allocator callbacks are outside the initial API. The baseline encoder requires
the original uncompressed size before it emits the stream header. Supporting an
unknown original size requires an explicit later format variant or compatible
versioned extension.

## DD-006: Independent implementation terminology

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Describe the project as a **specification-driven independent implementation**.
Do not claim a formal clean-room process or a legal guarantee. Algorithm work
is derived from recorded specifications, papers, and independently written
designs rather than implementation source code with incompatible provenance.

## DD-007: Foundational integer and bit primitives

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Serialization primitives accept bounded spans and explicit offsets. They return
failure without performing an out-of-bounds access. Offset and allocation-size
calculations use checked addition and multiplication helpers.

The bit writer retains at most one pending byte across calls. A write may consume
bits without producing a byte, and a later call may produce that byte without
new logical input. Finishing emits the pending byte with zero high-bit padding.
The bit reader exposes consumed-byte and produced-bit counts independently and
can validate zero padding before byte alignment. These low-level results use a
dedicated completion status rather than the transform-level `Progress` status.

## DD-008: Limits precede frame-format allocation

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Keep policy limits separate from decoder state and parsed frame bounds. Validate
the policy at decoder creation. After reading only the bounded fixed header,
validate all declared regions and their checked sum before allocating model or
block buffers. Track cumulative output separately so individually valid frames
cannot exceed the whole-stream limit.

Expansion validation uses `compressed_size * ratio + fixed_slack`. The fixed
slack permits valid small and low-payload frames, while the ratio constrains
large malicious expansion. Overflow in this calculation saturates the allowed
value at the unsigned 64-bit maximum; overflow in a declared allocation sum is
an error.

Initial conservative policy defaults are implementation defaults, not encoded
format limits. Applications may lower them. A future format may impose stricter
limits, but no format declaration may raise an application's configured limit.

## DD-009: GoogleTest as test-only infrastructure

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Use GoogleTest for C++ unit tests and CTest discovery. Keep the pure-C ABI smoke
test as a C translation unit independent of GoogleTest. GoogleTest is a test-only
Git submodule pinned to a reviewed commit; marc library targets never link it.

Tests default to enabled only when marc is the top-level CMake project. A parent
project can build marc without initializing the submodule. When tests are
explicitly enabled and the submodule is absent, configuration fails with an
actionable diagnostic rather than downloading code implicitly.

After publication, Dependabot may propose gitlink updates. Updates are reviewed
and accepted only after CI succeeds; the default branch always records one exact
GoogleTest commit.

## DD-010: Collect fixed framing prefixes before semantic parsing

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Use an allocation-free, compile-time-sized accumulator for stream and frame
header prefixes. It reports input consumption independently, accepts arbitrary
splits including one byte at a time, and never consumes bytes following the
prefix. Semantic parsers can obtain a read-only span only after collection is
complete.

Reset zeroes storage before reuse so stale header bytes are not exposed through
diagnostics or future mistakes. A zero-sized accumulator is valid and complete
at construction. The accumulator does not define a wire format; it supports a
future versioned parser without prematurely assigning format identifiers.

## DD-011: Version 1.0 has a fixed 64-byte stream prefix

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Assign the `MARC` magic and stream-format version 1.0 to a 64-byte fixed prefix.
Keep ABI and stream-format versions independent. The prefix identifies the
pipeline, bounded region lengths, frame and entropy-block units, and the known
original size without serializing a native structure.

Reserve explicit algorithm IDs now, while leaving codec-specific parameter and
payload layouts pending until each codec's documentation-first implementation.
Only variant 1 baseline names from `format.md` are recognized. Feature flags,
hash descriptors, and header extensions remain zero until their exact layouts
are defined; this prevents permissive parsing from assigning them accidental
semantics.

## DD-012: Frames are sequenced deterministic decode units

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Use a fixed 56-byte frame header with its own `MRF1` magic. Store both the
uncompressed output size and dictionary-serialized byte size because entropy
decoding and dictionary decoding have distinct bounded outputs. Store exact
compressed payload and block-descriptor lengths so both can be validated before
buffered entropy decoding.

Apply an independent local limit to dictionary-serialized bytes. This field is
the entropy decoder's output bound even when it can be streamed, so it must not
inherit either the raw frame limit or compressed-payload limit implicitly.

Derive the required uncompressed frame size from the stream's known original
size and configured frame size. Non-final frames cannot be short, frames cannot
continue after declared output completion, and sequence numbers must match the
controller's expected zero-based value. This makes frame boundaries and output
deterministic without a separate end marker.

## DD-013: Use MSBuild for the canonical Windows build

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Use CMake's Visual Studio 2026 generator for the canonical Windows x64 build,
which delegates dependency tracking and compilation to MSBuild. Use Ninja as
the canonical preset on non-Windows hosts.

This choice follows a reproduced failure where localized MSVC `/showIncludes`
output was recorded with an encoding mismatch and Ninja retained an object built
against an older internal structure layout. A clean build detected no production
defect, but relying on localized diagnostic text is unnecessarily fragile.
Presets contain no installation path; CMake selects the Visual Studio instance,
while machine-specific overrides belong in ignored `CMakeUserPresets.json`.

## DD-014: Hash only explicitly committed byte prefixes

- Date: 2026-07-12
- Status: accepted

Inject hash implementations through a non-owning, no-throw `IHashAlgorithm`
interface. `HashTap::commit` accepts an available span and committed prefix
length, updates exactly that prefix, and tracks a checked 64-bit total. This
matches partial downstream writes without coupling codecs to hash algorithms.

Finalize requires an exactly sized caller-owned digest buffer and is terminal
after success. Hash algorithm failures and byte-count overflow are terminal;
invalid caller arguments leave the running state retryable. Reset is explicit
so frame, block, and whole-stream scopes cannot be conflated implicitly.
