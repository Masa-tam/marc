# Architecture

## Baseline

marc is a C++20 library of bounded, stateful byte-stream transforms. MSVC is
the reference toolchain, but the implementation avoids compiler extensions and
keeps portable C++ as a design constraint. CMake is the canonical build
description.

On Windows, the canonical preset uses the Visual Studio 2026 generator and
MSBuild. Non-Windows presets use Ninja with the platform's selected compiler.
This avoids depending on localized MSVC `/showIncludes` text for incremental
dependency tracking while retaining Ninja's straightforward portable workflow
on platforms where compiler dependency files are locale-independent.

Canonical commands are:

```text
cmake --preset windows-msvc
cmake --build --preset windows-msvc-debug
ctest --preset windows-msvc-debug
```

Use the corresponding `ninja-debug` or `ninja-release` presets on non-Windows
hosts. `CMakeUserPresets.json` remains ignored for machine-local overrides.

The same source list builds both a static library and a shared library. The C
ABI is the binary boundary; C++ implementation types are never exported as ABI.

## Layers

Encoding flows from raw input through an optional dictionary transform, an
entropy transform, and the frame controller to a sink. Decoding reverses that
order. Direction is immutable for a transform instance.

Entropy blocks cannot cross frame boundaries. A frame may contain multiple
entropy blocks, and its last entropy block may be shorter than the configured
entropy block size. A frame boundary finalizes and resets every layer whose
state is scoped to that frame.

## Error and ownership policy

Normal control flow does not use exceptions. Public C++ processing functions
are `noexcept`, and no exception may cross the C ABI. Allocation failures and
unexpected internal exceptions at ABI adapters are converted to stable status
codes. Compiler exception support remains enabled so standard-library failures
can be contained safely.

Opaque C handles are created and destroyed by marc. The initial ABI does not
accept allocator callbacks and does not return variable-sized library-owned
buffers. Caller-provided input, output, and diagnostic buffers retain caller
ownership.

## Initial stream-size policy

The baseline framed format requires the original uncompressed size to be known
when encoding begins. Unknown-size streams are a future format capability, not
a baseline requirement. The transform API remains incremental; known size does
not imply that the complete input must be buffered.

## Decoder limits and frame validation

Limits are supplied to the decoder before stream parsing. Their configuration
is validated once, and every decoder-visible size is checked before allocation
or payload decoding. A parsed frame is represented by a `FrameBounds` summary;
validation checks individual dimensions, cumulative output, expansion, and the
sum of simultaneously buffered regions using checked arithmetic.

The frame controller will own the transition from header validation to model
construction and payload decoding. No entropy or dictionary decoder may
allocate from an unvalidated stream length. Validation failure leaves the
controller in its terminal error state and must produce a stable limit error.

### Incremental header collection

The framing parser first collects each fixed-size prefix into a compile-time
bounded accumulator. Collection consumes exactly the bytes still required for
that prefix and leaves following payload bytes untouched. Header bytes are not
exposed to semantic parsing until the prefix is complete. This keeps partial
input, truncation, and header validation separate and makes every split point
testable without allocating from stream-controlled data.

Variable-size header regions will be accepted only after their lengths have
been parsed from a complete fixed prefix and checked against decoder limits.
