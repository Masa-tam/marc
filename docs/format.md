# Stream format

The baseline byte representation is not yet assigned a format version. No
encoder implementation may be added until its complete decoder-visible layout
is specified here and accompanied by hand-checkable vectors.

Accepted baseline constraints:

- multi-byte integers are little-endian;
- bit payloads are LSB-first;
- the original uncompressed size is present and known;
- entropy blocks do not cross frame boundaries;
- one frame may contain multiple entropy blocks;
- the last entropy block in a frame may be short;
- no public standalone Static Huffman algorithm ID will be assigned.

ABI version 1 does not imply stream-format version 1. These namespaces evolve
independently.
