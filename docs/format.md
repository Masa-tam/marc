# Stream format

The baseline byte representation is not yet assigned a format version. No
encoder implementation may be added until its complete decoder-visible layout
is specified here and accompanied by hand-checkable vectors.

Accepted baseline constraints:

- multi-byte integers are little-endian;
- bit payloads are LSB-first;
- the original uncompressed size is present and known;
- entropy blocks do not cross frame boundaries;
- one frame may contain multiple entropy blocks;
- the last entropy block in a frame may be short;
- no public standalone Static Huffman algorithm ID will be assigned.

ABI version 1 does not imply stream-format version 1. These namespaces evolve
independently.

## Foundational hand-checkable vectors

These vectors define primitives used by every later format variant.

| Operation | Logical value or bits | Serialized bytes |
|---|---:|---:|
| store little-endian 16 | `0x1234` | `34 12` |
| store little-endian 32 | `0x12345678` | `78 56 34 12` |
| store little-endian 64 | `0x0123456789ABCDEF` | `EF CD AB 89 67 45 23 01` |
| write bits | `1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0` | `4D` |
| write 3 bits then finish | `1,0,1` | `05` |

For the final vector, bits 3 through 7 are padding and must be zero. Strict
alignment rejects, for example, byte `FD` after consuming its low three bits.

## Limits versus format fields

Decoder limits are local policy and are not serialized. The future stream and
frame headers will declare the sizes required to validate one frame. Header
parsing must not allocate based on those declarations until all applicable
policy checks succeed.

The baseline implementation defaults are:

| Limit | Default |
|---|---:|
| total decoded output | 1 TiB |
| one uncompressed frame | 16 MiB |
| one entropy block | 1 MiB |
| one compressed frame payload | 64 MiB |
| dictionary entries | 16,777,216 |
| LZ distance | 16 MiB |
| LZ match length | 1 MiB |
| Huffman code length | 24 bits |
| entropy table entries | 1,048,576 |
| range-model total | 16,777,216 |
| simultaneously buffered bytes | 128 MiB |
| entropy blocks per frame | 65,536 |
| expansion ratio | 1024:1 plus 1 MiB slack |

These values bound what the implementation accepts; they do not select codec
parameters. For example, the later Blocked Huffman format may specify a maximum
code length lower than the policy ceiling.
