# Changelog

This file records user-visible marc changes. Project release versions, stream
format versions, and C ABI versions are independent namespaces.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-19

Initial public source release candidate.

### Added

- C++20 static and shared libraries built from the same portable source set.
- A small exception-free C ABI with caller-owned, bounded workspaces.
- Five standalone entropy profiles: Blocked Huffman, Adaptive Huffman (FGK),
  Dynamic Range Coder, rANS, and tANS.
- Six standalone dictionary profiles: LZ77, LZSS, LZ78, LZW, LZD
  (Lempel-Ziv Double), and LZMW.
- All six dictionary profiles composed with Blocked Huffman.
- The version 1.1 `checksum-raw` profile with per-frame CRC-32C.
- Deterministic known-size framing, strict malformed-stream validation,
  configurable decode limits, arbitrary input/output chunking, and stable error
  categories across all eighteen public profiles.
- A command-line tool, CMake install package, pure-C consumer example,
  dependency-free benchmark harness, bounded decoder fuzz targets, and
  versioned interoperability bundles.
- Windows/MSVC and Ubuntu/Ninja CI with shared-only and static-only installed
  package consumers.
- Specification-driven independent-implementation records, exact stream-format
  documentation, and bidirectional Windows/Linux x86-64 interoperability
  evidence.

### Compatibility notice

The project is still in the 0.x series. Stream formats 1.0 and 1.1 and C ABI 1
are explicitly versioned, but long-term compatibility is not yet promised.
Unknown-size input, allocator callbacks, authentication, archive metadata, and
solid grouping are outside this release candidate.
